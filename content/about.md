# About me

My current occupations:
- 4th year [Networking & IT Security](https://ontariotechu.ca/programs/undergraduate/computers-and-technology/information-technology-networking-and-information-technology-security) @ Ontario Tech University
- Lab assistant @ [ANTS Lab](https://businessandit.ontariotechu.ca/ants/index.php)
- T1 SOC Analyst @ [eSentire](https://www.esentire.com)

I also used to be president of [Netsoc](https://netsoc.ca) (2023-2024).

In my 2 years at eSentire I've become highly proficient at performing in depth security investigations using a variety of different security products.

I've worked on various different projects at the ANTS lab, but the one I am most proud of is my contribution to the IAEA's Asherah Nuclear Power Plant Simulator (ANS). ANS is designed to be used for security training exercises, and I was responsible for integrating a SOC into the project stack using ELK. I have also made extensive enhancements to the existing project code to fix bugs and improve performance & stability. Additionally, I introduced Ansible playbooks to deploy the environment as an alterantive to monolithic Bash scripts. This work is in the progress of being open-sourced.

I have written a few things elsewhere:
