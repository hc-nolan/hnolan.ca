If this doesn't solve my wrist pain, at least I have something new to be annoyingly nerdy about.

## My Ergonomic Journey

Since my IT career began about 5 years ago, I've experienced extensive wrist pain due to prior injuries from [skateboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajn_cyjzj6s) in my youth. Making things worst, I have a ganglion cyst in my left wrist that slightly inhibits mobility. I've been interested in ergonomic keyboards for years, but I was always afraid of having to adjust the way I type, and concerned that I'd end up with a $500+ paperweight.

Roughly a year ago I took my first foray into a more ergonomic typing experience by purchasing a [Keychron V10 Max](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-v10-max-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard) (pictured below), which uses an Alice layout. I wanted to see if I'd be able to adjust to a split layout without breaking the bank, and it ended up being much easier than I anticipated. Some people worry that they won't be able to go back to typing on a normal keyboard after but I haven't had that issue at all. The V10 Max quickly became my favourite keyboard and I would definitely recommend it if you are in a similar position.

Once I'd fully adjusted to the V10 Max, I decided it was time to go for the real thing. This was followed by a period of ~6 months of indecision and research; dozens of bookmarks, tens of hours of YouTube videos, sitting at the checkout window debating whether to click *Pay Now*... Finally, I had a day at work where I had so much pain in my wrist that I had to stop typing with my left hand for a while and put ice on it. That was the day that I decided to make up my mind. The other main candidate apart from the Glove80 was the [Advantage360](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/adv360pro/), but coming in at $860CAD before tax, it's over $300 more expensive.

## The First 48

I have now had the Glove80 for just over 48 hours. Here are my first impressions:

- It's incredibly comfortable. Really can't wait until I can type full speed, because I can already see how it'll be easier on the hands/wrists
- I didn't realize how weak my right-hand pinky is. I thought that I typed with 10 fingers, but I'm realizing that I was actually only using 9, and am now being forced to learn how to use that last finger.
- My left hand already feels at home, but the right hand is giving me a good amount of trouble. Especially if I get lost and have to reseat my hand - I have to pretty much fully stop typing and look down to figure out where it's supposed to be.
- For now I am not doing any customization of the layout. There are a few keys that I've already wanted to switch around, but I decided that I'm going to get used to the overall layout first, and then once I figure out what still bothers me I'll start working on the customizations.

On my Alice layout board, I'm a relatively speedy typer - averaging around 150-160wpm. My first test with the Glove80 was a glacial 22wpm... Getting up to speed is going to be more painful than I initially thought.

By the end of day 1, I got up to about 25wpm with numbers + punctuation enabled, and about 40wpm with just letters. On day 2 I decided to just focus on letters, and ended the day around 55wpm.

I'd estimate I've been typing on it 1-2 hours per day. I'm not using it for work yet but I'm using it for most stuff on my personal computer.

It's now been about a week, and I am pretty comfortable. Not enough for work yet, but enough that I'm enjoying using it. I'm up to about 100wpm.
