If this doesn't solve my wrist pain, at least I have something new to be annoyingly nerdy about.

# My Ergonomic Journey

Since my IT career began about 5 years ago, I've experienced extensive wrist pain due to prior injuries from [skateboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajn_cyjzj6s) in my youth. Making things worst, I have a ganglion cyst in my left wrist that slightly inhibits mobility. I've been interested in ergonomic keyboards for years, but I was always afraid of having to adjust the way I type, and concerned that I'd end up with a $500+ paperweight.

Roughly a year ago I took my first foray into a more ergonomic typing experience by purchasing a [Keychron V10 Max](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-v10-max-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard) (pictured below), which uses an Alice layout. I wanted to see if I'd be able to adjust to a split layout without breaking the bank, and it ended up being much easier than I anticipated. Some people worry that they won't be able to go back to typing on a normal keyboard after but I haven't had that issue at all. The V10 Max quickly became my favourite keyboard and I would definitely recommend it if you are in a similar position.

Once I'd fully adjusted to the V10 Max, I decided it was time to go for the real thing. This was followed by a period of ~6 months of indecision and research; dozens of bookmarks, tens of hours of YouTube videos, sitting at the checkout window debating whether to click *Pay Now*... Finally, I had a day at work where I had so much pain in my wrist that I had to stop typing with my left hand for a while and put ice on it. That was the day that I decided to make up my mind. The other main candidate apart from the Glove80 was the [Advantage360](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/adv360pro/), but coming in at $860CAD before tax, it's over $300 more expensive.
